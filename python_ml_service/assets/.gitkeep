# Placeholder file for trained model weights
# 
# To use the service, you need to either:
# 1. Train your own model using: poetry run python -m training.train
# 2. Download pretrained weights and place them here
#
# The model will be automatically loaded on service startup
# If no weights are found, the service will use pretrained ImageNet weights
